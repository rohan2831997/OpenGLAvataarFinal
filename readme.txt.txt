README for Windowed Application with Rendering of Spheres



Introduction

Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to present my project. Before diving into the code, I recommend watching the accompanying video for a comprehensive understanding. Below are the essential details and steps to navigate through the solution. Also the colour of the spheres changes on RIGHT-CLICK and not LEFT CLICK. I have implemented a different functionality with left clicks.



Features and Implementation:

Object-Oriented Approach:
The application is structured using an object-oriented paradigm. It includes a primary class, an EBO (Element Buffer Object), and shader implementations for rendering.



Shading Model:

1. Diffuse Factor: Varies linearly along the X-axis.
2. Specular Factor: Varies linearly along the Y-axis.



Interactivity:

1. Sphere Selection: Right-click on a sphere to change its color based on the normal vector (RGB calculation: color = (normal + 1) / 2).
Deselection: Right-clicking anywhere outside the spheres will reset the colors.

2. Navigation: Hold down the left mouse button to look around using the W, A, S, D keys for movement within the space.
Lighting:

3. Implemented point lighting with intensity inversely proportional to the distance.




Instructions:

1. Watch the Video: Begin by watching the accompanying video for a visual walkthrough of the application functionalities.
2. Build and Run: After familiarizing yourself with the video, proceed to build and run the program.
Navigation: Utilize the W, A, S, D keys for movement within the rendered space.
3. Interact with Spheres: Right-click on individual spheres to alter their color based on the described algorithm. Remember to click outside the spheres to reset the colors.




Feedback and Improvements:

I am open to any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Kindly review the video and the README thoroughly, and let me know if any additional modifications or clarifications are required. I look forward to working and learning with you in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
